# Desktop Notes

Desktop Notes is a frameless Electron overlay for pinning translucent sticky notes and checklists directly on top of every application. The controller stays compactâ€”mirroring the legacy Cheating Daddy squareâ€”and each note floats as an always-on-top window you can long-press anywhere to reposition.

## Features
# Fnote â€” Floatable Notes, Minimal & Powerful ðŸš€

![Fnote hero](assets/hero.png)

Fnote is a tiny, private, local-first sticky-note overlay that sits above your desktop apps â€” translucency, color, and zero friction. Think of it as a Postâ€‘it for the 21st century: instant, private, and always where you need it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start â€” run the app now (Windows PowerShell)

Clone, install, and run locally:

```powershell
# 1. Clone or make sure you're in the project folder
cd C:\path\to\fnote

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Run (development)
npm start

# 4. Build (package/makers are configured via Electron Forge)
npm run make
```

Notes:
- Use PowerShell (Windows) or your preferred shell on macOS/Linux (some commands vary).
- The app uses Electron; you may need to accept one-time prompts while installing native packages like better-sqlite3.

## What is Fnote? â€” product in one sentence

Fnote is a lightweight, always-on-top, translucent sticky-note utility for desktop power users who want frictionless note capture and a platform for tiny, delightful widgets.

## Why Fnote â€” the opportunity

- People use notes continuously: quick reminders, code snippets, meeting times, and ephemeral ideas. Current ecosystems scatter notes across cloud apps and passive widgets; the occasional note needs to be right on top of your workflow.
- Fnote is local-first, fast, and private â€” no account required to start. That lowers friction and increases retention for people who want instant notes without signups.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Target market & sizing (concise pitch numbers)

- Addressable market: Desktop productivity users (knowledge workers, devs, designers) â€” estimated hundreds of millions globally.
- Sticky-note / quick-note product vertical: overlaps with desktop utilities and productivity tools. Conservatively, 5â€“10% adoption among active desktop users in target segments is a multi-million user outcome.
- Mobile & web note apps are saturated; there is a clear gap for a tiny, desktop-native, always-on overlay that respects privacy and performance.

Market opportunity is real: small utilities can scale rapidly when they nail user experience and platform integration (examples: Spectacle, Bartender, Magnet, Evernoteâ€™s sticky notes, Notion widgets).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Vision & roadmap (how Fnote becomes a platform)

Phase 1 â€” Minimal sticky notes (MVP) â€” DONE/IN-PROGRESS
- Frameless, translucent notes that float above other windows.
- Drag anywhere and resize, color, and set opacity.
- Per-note font choices and persistence.

Phase 2 â€” Widgets & extensions (next 3â€“9 months)
- Add a clock widget, timers, and quick-action widgets (clipboard, todo quick-add, calendar peek).
- Each widget is a tiny web component (HTML/CSS/JS) packaged and loaded into Fnote windows.
- Create a curated widget marketplace: developers can publish small paid/free widgets, and users can install them instantly.

Phase 3 â€” Distribution & scale (9â€“24 months)
- Desktop installers for Windows (.exe / Squirrel / NSIS) and macOS (.dmg), optional MSIX for Store distribution.

- Extensible widget model (clock, timers, small utilities)

## Tech stack

- Electron + Node.js
- better-sqlite3 (SQLite)
- Electron Forge for packaging
- vitest for testing

## Roadmap

1. Stabilize core note UX and persistence
2. Add first widgets: clock, timer, clipboard quick-add
3. Widget sandbox and curated marketplace
4. Cross-platform packaging and distribution

## Packaging

```powershell
npm run make
```
